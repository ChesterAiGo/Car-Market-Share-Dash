# CarMarketStats

CarMarketStats - designed to simplify the process of selecting your next vehicle.
App is running at: https://car-market-share-dash.onrender.com

## Introduction

Choosing a car that fits one's needs and budget can be an exhaustive task due to the abundance of options available in the market. To make a better decision, it is essential to have a fundamental understanding of the current market share of some popular car brands, as well as the prices and features of the models that suit one's needs. However, obtaining this information can be time-consuming and overwhelming, especially for those who are not familiar with the automotive industry.

This is where our app comes in. **We design this app to help people navigate the car market and make informed decisions.** Our app provides a user-friendly interface that displays the market share of popular car brands and models, as well as rankings based on other factors such as price and fuel efficiency. By using our app, users can quickly get a sense of the current car market and make informed decisions when selecting a car that fits their needs. Our target audience is people who want to obtain a fundamental understanding of the current car market but do not know where to start, and we hope you enjoy using this CarMarketStats app.

## Setup

While the app can both be accessed locally and via [link], it is recommended to access it via service provided by Render.

To run it locally, simply follow these steps:

1. Make sure Internet is connected, as this app loads data from Github.com
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. python app.py
4. Access it via http://127.0.0.1:8050/


## Usage

The app has been designed to be as intuitive as possible in order to minimize user effort. With that being said, here are some simple instructions on how to properly use the app.

Firstly, below the title, there is a pie chart which displays the market share of popular car brands. By default, the chart is set to display data by `Manufacturer`, however, users can click on the `Model` radio button to view market share by specific car models. As there are numerous car models available, the pie chart only displays data for the top 10 models.

Furthermore, the app also offers a feature which allows users to filter and view cars sorted by a bar chart. This chart displays cars according to their price and fuel efficiency, and users can choose the number of cars they want to view by using the slider bar below. This section is specifically designed to enable users to quickly browse the top cars based on their preferences.
